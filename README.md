# Simple.emu
This is an app created in python where it emulates a TX11 processor with some simple commands: add, mul, sub, cmp, mov, and load. Feel free to add whatever you want by forking it. You can reach me at txpert1112@gmail.com. You can either run the .py file in the python folder with no modules needed. I haven't tested python versions other than the newest versions but they may work. I just recommend using the newest version. You can use gcc to compile the c version in the C folder. You can install it from this link: https://sourceforge.net/projects/gcc-win64/
